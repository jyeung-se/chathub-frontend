# chathub-frontend


Instructions for use:

To build:
Vite Build

To start:
npm run dev

-------------------------

Login using username "demo" (case-sensitive) to see some premade group chat interactions.
OR, create your own username and create a new group chat. Then add people to them for real time messaging.
You can open a separate tab and sign in with multiple usernames and chat one another to see it realtime!

NOTE! - There is a max username limit in place of usernames on the server at once. Try 'demo' username if you are not able to make a new one due to max capacity.
